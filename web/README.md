# Viscose

A portfolio carousel rendered as a single WebGL shader. Project cards ride a
ring that sits mostly off-screen, so you see a tall arc of work sweeping past.
Scroll, drag or swipe to turn it; it settles with a card facing front.

_Viscose: a viscous state, and a fibre spun by drawing that state into a
thread. Which is what the cards do when they pull apart._

![The carousel at rest — the front card centred, its number and name to the
left, discipline and year to the right, and the full index top
right](docs/carousel.png)

The cards are not images in a grid. The whole ring is one full-screen fragment
shader drawing signed distance fields, which is what lets neighbouring cards
melt into one another as they close up and string thin threads as they pull
apart. The cursor doesn't draw anything — it softens the surface under itself,
leans nearby cards toward it and webs honey back between them.

**[Read the breakdown →](BREAKDOWN.md)** — where the idea came from, how
viscosity became a distance field, and the four things that only showed up
once it moved.

<!-- TODO: a screen recording would sell this far better than stills. The
     whole point is what happens between frames. -->

## Quick start

Requires **Node 20 or newer**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yousuf-developer/viscose.git
cd viscose
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | dev server       |
| `npm run build` | production build |
| `npm start`     | serve the build  |
| `npm run lint`  | eslint           |

Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Three.js, GSAP and Tailwind v4.

## What you can interact with

- **Scroll or drag** to turn the ring. It has momentum and snaps to the
  nearest card.
- **Hover a card** to soften the field around it, push its neighbours aside
  and string threads between them.
- **Click an off-centre card** to turn the ring smoothly until it's at the
  front.
- **On touch**, swipe to turn and press-and-hold for the hover effects — a
  finger has no hover state, so it sits behind a deliberate gesture.

![Hovering a card: the neighbours above and below have backed away and dimmed,
threads stretch between them, and the View tag has appeared on the
cursor](docs/hover.png)

The threads are not drawn between the cards — they're part of the same
distance field, so they thin, sag and dissolve on their own as the gap opens.
The glass lip along the top and bottom edges is refracting the two neighbours
into those swept shapes, and that too is the same shader pass.

## The dev panel

In development a [lil-gui](https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/) panel appears
top-right with every tunable in the project — around 136 of them, grouped by
what they affect. Drag a slider and the change is live.

It never ships: the panel and lil-gui itself are both behind a dynamic import
guarded by `NODE_ENV === "development"`.

**Before you tune anything**, open the **fit** folder and check that `scale`
reads `1.000`. Every pixel measurement in the project is quoted against a
reference window (a 14" MacBook Pro, 1512 points wide). On a different screen
you'd be tuning against a scale factor that isn't 1, and the result will look
right for you and wrong for everyone else. There's a **`use this window as
ref`** button that fixes this in one click.

| `pointer` / `side cards` | how the ring reacts to a cursor                                |

## Making it yours

### Projects

Everything lives in one array, `components/ring/projects.js`:

```js
{ file: "10.webp", name: "Matchday", type: "Motion", year: "2025" }
```

Drop an image in `public/`, add a row, done. The array does four jobs at once —
it's the atlas packing order, the order art is dealt around the ring, the
project column top-right, and the `01`–`18` numbering. Reordering rows moves
all four together.

> **The list is in ring order, not filename order.** It reads shuffled against
> the file numbers, and that's deliberate: entry _n_ sits one slot along the
> ring from entry _n−1_, which is what lets the column count up as the carousel
> turns. Reorder these rows to change the sequence; don't reach for
> `imageOffset`, which rotates the art without moving the list with it.

All of the sample data is placeholder: every `type` and `year` is invented,
names marked `(*)` are guesses at the subject, and **the images are other
people's work** collected to build the layout against. See
[About the artwork](#about-the-artwork).

### Fonts

Three families, declared in `app/globals.css` and looked up **by name** from
`components/ring/params.js` — so if you swap one, change it in both places.

## How it's put together

```
app/
  page.js            renders <Carousel />
  globals.css        Tailwind, @font-face, page background

components/
  Carousel.jsx      the component — renderer, resize, input, per-frame
                     layout, entry timeline
  ring/
    projects.js      the work
    params.js        every tunable
    utils.js         maths helpers
    atlas.js         packs all the art into one texture
    meta.js          the type either side of the ring
    splitText.js     the intro heading
    tag.js           the "View" tag on the cursor
    gui.js           the dev panel
  shaders/
    planeShaders.js  the ring — SDFs, goo, glass, tag
    textShaders.js   the heading's per-glyph reveal
```

Two ideas explain most of the rest.

**One shader, one draw call.** The ring, the threads between cards, the glass
lip along the screen edges and the cursor tag are all evaluated per pixel in
`planeShaders.js`. Card positions arrive as uniform arrays, and the fragment
shader blends their distance fields with a smooth minimum — that soft blend is
the goo. Because the tag is drawn in the same pass, its label can invert
against whatever pixels it happens to be sitting on.

![The ring mid-entry: cards on the right have separated cleanly while those on
the left are still fused into one another with thick necks between
them](docs/entry.png)

The entry is the clearest look at what the smooth minimum is doing. Every card
starts merged inside the one before it and peels away in sequence, so at any
moment during the unfurl some pairs have fully separated, some are joined by a
thinning neck, and some are still one blob.

**Loading is part of the animation.** The atlas binds on the first frame and
fills in as images arrive, with the first card's art requested at high priority
so it can be shown while the rest are still downloading. The counter at the
bottom of the screen isn't a readout beside the entry — it _is_ the gate. The
seed card is born, holds at centre, and the ring launches on the frame the
number reaches 100.

For the deeper technical notes — coordinate conventions, the responsive model,
and the handful of things here that look like bugs but aren't — see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Status

This is a work in progress, published because the rendering approach might be
useful to someone. Known gaps:

- **Clicking a card centres it but doesn't open anything.** The "View" tag
  promises a destination that doesn't exist yet.
- **No reduced-motion support.** Six seconds of animated blur with no escape
  hatch.
- **No keyboard control.** Arrow keys should step the ring; the project column
  can't be clicked to jump.
- **Phone widths are approximate.** The tight breakpoint was tuned at the 640
  end of its range and drifts below ~500px.
- **No tests.** `npm run build` and `npm run lint` are the whole safety net,
  and GLSL only compiles at runtime — a shader typo builds green.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

- Run `npm run lint` and `npx prettier --write .` before opening a PR.
- Load the page after touching anything in `components/shaders/` — GLSL is
  compiled in the browser, so a build passing proves nothing about it.
- New tunables belong in `params.js` with a matching control in `ring/gui.js`,
  not hardcoded in the layout loop.
- Please don't commit font binaries or client artwork.

## Credits

- The gooey text morph — two blurred copies fused through an SVG alpha
  threshold — is a widely circulated CodePen technique, adapted here to run
  one-shot per card change instead of on a loop.

  Arts) and Stefan Gustavson, MIT.

### About the artwork

The project images are **not mine**. I picked them up from Behance, more or
less at random, purely so there was real work to build and judge the layout
against — a carousel full of grey rectangles tells you nothing about whether
the thing looks good.

I claim no ownership of any of it, the MIT licence above does not extend to
it, and none of this is an endorsement of reusing it. If you fork this,
replace the images with your own work.

The names, disciplines and years shown next to them are invented placeholders
and are not claims about who made what.
