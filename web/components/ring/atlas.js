 * Packs every image into one texture. A single atlas rather than one texture
 * per plane because ESSL 1.00 cannot index an array of samplers with a
 * non-constant index.
 *
 * Returns synchronously with the sheet blank and filling in as images arrive:
 * the caller needs something to bind on frame one, and the entry shows cell 0
 * while the rest are still coming.
 *
 * `first` settles once cell 0 is on the texture, `ready` once all of them are.
 * Neither rejects — a missing file leaves its cell blank and still counts as
 * settled, so one bad path cannot strand the entry.
