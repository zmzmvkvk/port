/**
 * The two lockups of type either side of the ring: [number . name] on the
 * left, [type . year] on the right. Both read whatever card is facing front.
 *
 * Changing card melts one set of words into the next. Two copies are stacked,
 * one blurred out as the other blurs in, and the pair run through an alpha
 * threshold that forces every pixel above a cut solid and drops the rest. Two
 * soft edges drifting past each other cross that cut as one shape, which is
 * what makes the words run together and pull apart instead of crossfading.
 * None of it is per-glyph.
 *
 * A word that is not actually changing — the same year twice running — is
 * held instead of melted. Holding it in place is not enough on its own: the
 * threshold has to span both layers for them to fuse, so anything inside it
 * gets thresholded whether it moves or not and a held word visibly thickens.
 * So each group carries a third row outside the filtered subtree and paints
 * carried-over words from there.
 *
 * All three rows always hold both words, painted or not. The row is what
 * positions the other word, and a missing one would move it.
